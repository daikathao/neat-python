 # Applying the NEAT algorithm to the Snake game
 
 This is a project aiming to explore the potential of reinforcement learning techniques combined with genetic algorithms as explained in the paper about the Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (link: https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) when applied to "simple" goal based classic games, namely, Snake.
 
 This project includes:
 * A full implementation of the Snake game, using PyGame.
 * A setup of the learning algorithm, helped with the neat-python library's implementation of it.
 * A training mode and a testing mode.
 
 Preview of the training phase:
